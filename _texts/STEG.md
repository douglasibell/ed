The attached narrative pertains
to Military Government's and its
German counterpart organization's
participation in all programs concerning
transfers of Captured Enemy
Material and U.S. Army Surplus to
the German economy in Bavaria.

INTRODUCTION

With the cessation of hostilities, vast quantities
of Wehrmacht supplies and equipment were abandoned by tne
German Armed Forces. These stocks were located in dispersed
military establishments, factories, warehouses
and railway freight cars throughout Bavaria. The Commanding
General, Third U.S. Army, seized all abandoned
unpilfered stocks as war booty along with materials captured
in combat.

Upon formation of Military Government, the control
and responsibility for part of the Captured Enemy Material
stocks were delegated to the Supply Branch, Military Government.
Their primary function was supply, maintenance, and
care of Displaced Persons.

In addition to an acute problem of disease and unrest
that required immediate relief, the Occupation Forces were
confronted with an economy suffering from serious shortages
of every known commodity and raw material, which were, in
major proportions, available in Captured Enemy Material
stocks. It could be readily realized that these stocks,
because of a complete collapse of the German economy, partially
served as foundation for the recovery. Until April
1946, the distribution and allocation of these materials
were the responsibility of the Industry Branch, Economics
Division, Military Government. This procedure was maintained
until.the Ministry of Economics effected an organization
to effeciently distribute the materials into
the economy. A system of allocation was created wherein
applications for materials and equipment were submitted
to the Chief of the Industry Branch for approval. Requests
for releases were studied in relation to their importance
to the economy, taking into consideration the balance of
stocks on hand for future needs. All demands were subject
to further approval by the Requirements and Allocations
Section. The Supply Branch, through the Official Receipts
Section, accounted for all released materials and required
that a11 collected proceeds be deposited in a special
blocked account, The Minister of Economics formed a German
counterpart organization known as the "Landesabwicklungsstelle".

Later, the Landesabwicklungsstelle was charged with
full accountability and responsibility for all Captured
Enemy Material stocks not under control of a military
echelon. In fulfilling its mission, custodians were
appointed under the title of "Treuhaender fuer Wehrmachtsgut".
Normally, they were Buergermeisters or Landrats who
were placed under the supervision of the local Military Government Director. It was soon realized that stocks
placed under the control of these custodians lacked
effectual control or distribution. In numerous instances,
the officials were more concerned with the local
economy than with the needs and the importance of supplies
to the whole economy. Proceeds collected by custodians
for the sale of materials were paid into blocked accounts;
however, in some instances, they were diverted and used
for local administration or for financing special projects.

This system of control engendered a maldistribution
of materials which resulted in partially hoarded stocks
available only at black market prices.

Unfortunately, the small enforcing administrative
group of the Landesabwicklungsstelle was insufficient to
cope with backyard politics, thus permitting uninventoried
stocks to evaporate into the local economy without
accountability.

Coincidentally, the Property Control Division of
Military Government organized a German agency entitled
"Landesamt fuer Vermoegensverwaltung und Wiedergutmachung".
This organization conflicted, in part, with the Landesabwicklungsstelle
in that their policy concerning Captured
Enemy Material was not clear in its definition. Later,
this was clarified and all movable property falling within 
the category as described in Property Control Circular No. 4,
dated 28 April 1947, was recleased to the Lanaesabwicklungsstelle.
In part, Cartured Enemy Material was defined as follows:

"a. It must have been movable property
owned or held for direct military
use by enemy military forces.

"b. It must have beem acquired by the
U.S. Army in most cases not later
than 8 May 1945, but in no case
later than 5 June 1945.

"c. It must have been seized by the
U.S. Army and reduced to 'firm
possession'. The term 'firm
possession' is considered to require
manifestation of intention
to seize the particular property
and to exercise some type of
custody or possession thereof."

Doubtless, the intent of the clarification gained its objective
in placing the line of demarcation or responsibility;
however, it permitted urgently needed equipment to
lie dormant or uncontrolled until un investigation determind 
the responsible agency.

Therefore, in order to implement a planned economy
based on available stocks and to assure an equitable
distribution, OMGUS urged the formation of an organization
to be held liable for accountability, segregation, and
distribution of Captured Enemy Material.

The Minister Presidents, at the direction of OMGUS
through the Laenderrat, organized the "Gesellschaft zur
Erfassung von Ruestungsgut mbH. (GER)" on 29 August 1946.
This company was a German public corporation with the
Ministers of Finance and Economics as shareholders.

The main office of the Gesellschnft zur Erfassung
van Ruestungsgut was established in Munich. The Landesabwicklungsstelle
was absorbed by the Corporation as
Zweigstelle Bayern, Branch Bavaria, with Dr. Oskar Witt
as manager. The initial organizational plan is attached
as Exhibit A.

The planned progrnms listed below, directed by OMGUS,
required a realignment within the new organization to
achieve synchronization.
a. Captured Enemy Material Program
b. U.S. Surplus Program
c. Aluminum Reduction and Disassembly
Program.

During the interim, the Gesellschaft zur Erfassung
von Ruestungsgut was compelled to function under the 
directives of the Landesabwicklungsstelle.

With the formation of the Gsellschaft zur Erfassung
van Ruestungsgut, the responsibilities for coordinution, release
of Captured Enemy material and supervision were
placed with the Program Review Section, Industry Branch,
Economics Division, Office of Military Government for
Bavaria. The personnel assigned to assist in the implementation 
of the OMGUS directives totalled two and, later,
as additionul responsibilities and duties were delegated,
the staff was increased to seven. These responsibilities
and duties mny be clarified as follows:

a. Implementation of OMGUS directives.

b. Supervision of Gesellschaft zur
Erfassung von Ruestungsgut activities
relative to OMGUS directives.

c. Follow-up on demilitarization of
war potential equipment.

d. Coordinate with pertinent Military
Government units, U.S. Army, and
Gesellschaft zur Erfassung von
Ruestungsgut on matters pertaining
to critical, restricted, and restitutable
items.

e. Releuse to the Germen economy
through the Gesellschaft zur
Erfassung von Ruestungsgut
all Captured Enemy Material
surplus to the needs of the
Occupation Forces.

Anticipating the US/UK fusion, the Gescllschaft zur
Erfassung von Ruestungsgut changed the title of the corpo
ration to Staatliche Erfassungs-Gesellschuft fuer
oeffentliches Gut (STEG), (Public Corporation for the
Utilization of Public Property), during August 1947.
The organizational plan is attahched as exhibit B.
The vast und extensive turnovers of both U.S. Army
surplus and CEM imposed considerable responsibility, coordination,
control and supervision upon Military Government.
Thereupon, OMGUS created the OMGSTEG Branch,
Commerce & Industry Group, Bipartite Control Office with
Branch Offices in each land. The Bavarian Branch Office
functioned with a staff of seven persons, enveloping the
same responsibilities as those outlined in the preceding
paragraph, plus added duties occasioned by transfers of
U.S. surplus property. A seperate annotation concerning
the programs and their enveloping phases is included in
this report, as follows:
I Captured Enemy Material
II U.S. Surplus
III Aluminum Reduction and
Disassembly.

On the date of currency reform (20 June 1948) the 
STEG, like all other public institutions, was without
funds. The provisions of the law did not permit STEG
to retain its bank assets, nor were they entitled to the
conversion rate of 10 RM to 1 DM which was granted to all
depositers. In order to abridge the financial gap until
sales revenue could be obtained, the STEG secured a loan
of DM 750,000 which was repaid within 90 days.
